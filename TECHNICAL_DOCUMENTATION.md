# productflow.online - Technical Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the `productflow.online` application. It is intended for developers, architects, and technical product managers involved in the project.

The application is a sophisticated Single Page Application (SPA) designed to be an end-to-end command center for modern, outcome-driven product teams. It facilitates a "Golden Thread" of traceability from low-level user feedback up to high-level company strategy.

## 2. Architecture & Technology Stack

### 2.1. High-Level Architecture

-   **Frontend:** A pure client-side Single Page Application (SPA) built with **React 18** and **TypeScript**.
-   **Development Environment:** The application is built to run in a modern browser environment that supports ES Modules and Import Maps, simulating a Vite-like developer experience. There is no server-side rendering.
-   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** is used for all styling. A global configuration is defined in `app.html`, and utility classes are used directly in components. This ensures a consistent and maintainable design system.
-   **Dependencies:** All third-party libraries (React, Recharts) are loaded via CDN (`esm.sh`) specified in the `importmap` script tag in `app.html`.

### 2.2. Technology Stack

-   **Core Framework:** React 18
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **Charting:** Recharts
-   **Data Fetching:** All data operations are simulated via a mock API layer (`services/mockData.ts`) that mimics asynchronous calls with a small delay.

## 3. State Management

Global state is managed using **React's Context API**. This approach was chosen for its simplicity and built-in nature, avoiding the need for external state management libraries like Redux for this project's scale.

The application is wrapped in three main context providers in `index.tsx`:

-   **`AuthProvider` (`context/AuthContext.tsx`):**
    -   **Responsibility:** Manages the current user session. It fetches all users on load and "logs in" the first user by default to simulate an authenticated state.
    -   **Exposes:** `currentUser`, `users`, `loading`, and functions like `login`, `logout`, and `switchUser`.

-   **`AppProvider` (`context/AppContext.tsx`):**
    -   **Responsibility:** This is the main data provider for the entire application. It fetches all core business entities (products, feedback, insights, etc.) on initial load and holds them in its state.
    -   **Exposes:** All application data (e.g., `products`, `feedbackClusters`, `insights`) and functions to mutate that data (e.g., `updateFeedbackCluster`, `addUpstreamInitiative`). All data modification logic is centralized here, making components responsible for UI only.

-   **`TourProvider` (`context/TourContext.tsx`):**
    -   **Responsibility:** Manages the state of the interactive product tour.
    -   **Exposes:** `isTourActive`, `currentStep`, `steps`, and functions to control the tour (`startTour`, `stopTour`, `nextStep`).

## 4. The "Golden Thread": Core Data Models

The "Golden Thread" is the central philosophy of the application, ensuring full traceability from a single user comment up to a company-wide objective. This is achieved through a set of interconnected data models defined in `types.ts`.

-   **`Insight`**: The atomic unit of raw user feedback (e.g., a single review, tweet, or support ticket comment).
-   **`Feedback` (Cluster)**: A synthesized theme or problem derived from one or more similar `Insight`s. This is where analysis, such as sentiment and impact scoring, occurs. *An `Insight` has a `feedbackId` linking it to its parent `Feedback` cluster.*
-   **`Hypothesis`**: A testable assumption derived from a `Feedback` cluster. E.g., "If we improve photo translator speed, then user satisfaction for that feature will increase." *A `Hypothesis` has `linkedFeedbackIds`.*
-   **`UpstreamInitiative`**: A significant piece of work or project designed to act on a validated `Hypothesis` or a strategic goal. It moves through the discovery Kanban board. *A `Hypothesis` can have a `linkedInitiativeId`.*
-   **`Objective` / `KeyResult` (OKR)**: A high-level strategic goal that an `UpstreamInitiative` is intended to impact. *An `UpstreamInitiative` has a `linkedOKRId`, and a `KeyResult` has `linkedInitiativeIds`.*
-   **`StrategicPillar`**: A foundational, long-term theme that guides product strategy. *An `Objective` has a `linkedPillarId`.*
-   **`CompanyStrategy`**: The highest-level vision and mission statements that all `StrategicPillar`s support.

This interconnected structure allows any user to click through the system and understand *why* a certain feature is being built, starting from the original user problem.

## 5. Project Structure

The project is organized into logical directories to separate concerns:

-   `/`: Contains HTML files (`index.html`, `app.html`, etc.) and root configuration.
-   `components/`: Contains all React components, further subdivided by feature area or type.
    -   `common/`: Highly reusable components used across the app (e.g., `AdvancedTable`, `Header`, `RichPopover`).
    -   `auth/`, `feedback/`, `product/`, `upstream/`, etc.: Components specific to a feature module.
-   `context/`: Contains all React Context providers (`AppContext`, `AuthContext`).
-   `pages/`: Top-level components that represent a full page or view within the application, composed of smaller components.
-   `services/`: Contains the mock API layer (`mockData.ts`).

## 6. Upstream (Discovery) Workflow

The Initiatives Work board is the core of the discovery process. It is designed to manage "Product Opportunities"‚Äîproblems to be solved, not pre-defined solutions. This process is flexible and adapts to the size of the opportunity.

### 6.1. Kanban Column Definitions

1.  **‚û°Ô∏è Backlog**: The inbox for all new ideas, problems, and opportunities.
2.  **ü§î Analysing Opportunity**: First filter. Assess potential value. *Key Questions: What problem are we solving? What is the potential gain? Does it align with our strategy?*
3.  **üßê Initial Research**: High-level research to understand the problem space. *Activities: Market analysis, initial technical feasibility assessment.*
4.  **üî¨ Deep Research**: The main discovery phase. *Activities: Detailed requirements analysis, user research, UX/UI concepts, technical PoCs. The opportunity is broken down into smaller Epics/Improvements here.*
5.  **üí¨ Input for Discussion**: The complete business case (problem, solution, costs, risks) is presented for a "go/no-go" decision. Success metrics are finalized.
6.  **üÖøÔ∏è Parked**: A "holding area" for good ideas that are not a priority right now. The reason for parking is documented.
7.  **‚è≥ Waiting for Development**: Approved and fully specified Epics/Improvements ready to be pulled into a development sprint. This is the handoff point to the Delivery team.
8.  **üõ†Ô∏è In Development**: Active downstream work is in progress on development team boards.
9.  **‚úÖ Released**: The solution is live. Data is being collected for post-release analysis.
10. **üèÜ Done**: All parts of the opportunity are released and the post-release analysis is complete, confirming the goal was met.

### 6.2. Workflow Principles (FAQ)

-   **Flexibility:** The process adapts. A small fix may fly through the early stages, while a major new product idea (e.g., "translation glasses") would involve extensive time and multiple PoCs in the `Deep Research` phase.
-   **Movement:** Cards can and should move backward if new information is discovered. Moving a card from `In Development` back to `Deep Research` due to a technical blocker is a sign of a healthy, adaptive process, not a failure.
-   **Discovery vs. Delivery:** This board is for **Discovery** (finding the right thing to build). The development team's board (e.g., in Jira) is for **Delivery** (building the thing right). The output of `Waiting for Development` is the input for the Delivery board's backlog.
-   **Closing the Loop:** An opportunity is only moved to `Done` after its impact has been measured against the success metrics defined in the `Input for Discussion` stage. This ensures the team is focused on outcomes, not just output.
-   **Rejection as Success:** Discovering in `Deep Research` that an idea is not viable is a successful outcome, as it saves development resources. Such opportunities are moved to `Parked` or a `Discarded` state with clear documentation on why.
