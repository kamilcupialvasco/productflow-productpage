                    It's a trap many product teams fall into. The roadmap is packed, the engineers are coding, and Jira tickets are moving across the board. Everyone is busy. But is anyone actually making an impact?

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feature factories measure success by output (features shipped).</li>
                    <li>Outcome-driven teams measure success by outcome (a measurable change in user behavior).</li>
                    <li>Shifting to outcomes empowers teams, fosters learning, and ties work directly to business value.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>This is the core dilemma that separates a "feature factory" from a truly outcome-driven product team. One measures success by output, while the other measures success by outcome.</p>

            <h2>What is a Feature Factory?</h2>
            <p>A feature factory is a team that is incentivized to ship, ship, ship. The primary measure of success is velocity. The backlog is a list of solutions pre-determined by stakeholders, and the team's job is simply to build them as quickly as possible. There's little room for discovery, validation, or learning.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "In a feature factory, the team is disconnected from the customer and the business. They're mercenaries, not missionaries." - Marty Cagan
            </blockquote>
            
            <h2>The Outcome-Driven Alternative</h2>
            <p>An outcome-driven team, on the other hand, starts with a problem to be solved or an outcome to be achieved. For example, instead of a goal to "build a new dashboard," the goal might be to "reduce customer support tickets related to billing by 20%."</p>
            <p>This subtle shift has profound implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> The team is given the autonomy to figure out the *best* way to achieve the outcome, rather than being handed a specific solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning:</strong> The focus is on experimentation and learning. Did the new feature actually move the needle? If not, what can we try next?</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Success is tied directly to business value, making the team's work more meaningful and impactful.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is why we built productflow.online. Our entire platform is designed to facilitate this shift, helping you create that "golden thread" from a high-level business objective all the way down to the user problem you're solving today.</p>
